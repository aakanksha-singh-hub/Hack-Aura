           Welcome to our Hackathon. This event is not just about building innovative solutions, but about fostering a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment. We believe that great ideas come from diverse teams working together with mutual respect and understanding. Each team in our hackathon includes at least one girl member to ensure gender diversity and representation, and to promote equal participation and leadership.
This Code of Conduct applies to all participants, organizers, volunteers, mentors, judges, and sponsors. By participating in this event, you agree to abide by the guidelines mentioned below.

          </p>
          <ul className="code-list">
            <li><span className="abc">Our Values:</span>
-Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level, gender, race, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability, or background.
- Respect, kindness, and inclusivity are non-negotiable. Every participant deserves to feel safe and valued.
- Collaboration is prioritized over competition. We believe that the best outcomes arise from working together with openness and support.
- We are committed to maintaining a harassment-free environment for everyone.
</li>
            <li><span className="abc">Behavior Expectations:</span>
1. Treat all participants with respect. Do not interrupt, talk over, or dismiss anyoneâ€™s ideas or presence.
2. Communicate professionally and constructively. Avoid sarcasm, personal attacks, or hostile remarks.
3. Be inclusive. Ensure that every team member, especially girl members, have equal opportunities to contribute and lead.
4. Be open to diverse ideas and different ways of thinking.
5. Use appropriate language at all times. Offensive or suggestive remarks will not be tolerated.
6. Give and receive feedback respectfully.
7. Celebrate differences. Diverse teams are stronger and more creative.

We have zero tolerance for the following:
- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination in any form
- Verbal abuse, threats, or intimidation

            <li><span className="abc">Inclusivity Commitment:</span>
Each team must ensure that all voices are heard. No member, especially the girl participant, should be sidelined, overruled, or ignored. Everyone has the right to speak, contribute, and feel ownership over the work created.
</li>
            <li><span className="abc">Teamwork and Mental Well-being:</span> 
We expect participants to:
- Support each other in learning and problem-solving
- Take care of their physical and mental health (rest, eat, hydrate)
- Be mindful of burnout and avoid glorifying overwork

Winning is not the only goal. Growth, collaboration, and experience matter equally.
